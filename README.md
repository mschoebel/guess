Python Guess
============

Simple Python implementation of the game "guess" aka. Mastermind.
Actually, this is just a collection of methods for analyzing the game.


Usage
-----

Execute ```python guess.py```.

This will show the optimal game for six colors and four places -- the "best" guess
(= reduces the number of possible solutions the most) is answered with the "best"
evaluation (= keeps the number of possible solutions maximized).
